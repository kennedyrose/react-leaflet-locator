# Inject script 

Injection is using the `build-scripts` command. It is using the inject script inside of `scripts/inject`. Currently testing with `test.html`. The purpose of this is to be injectable into any vanilla html project via script tag and data set html tag. Test the `test.html` inside the `dist` folder once it's done building.
